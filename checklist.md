# Product Manager (PM) Requirements Checklist

[cite_start]This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework to ensure the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Epic definitions are complete, well-structured, and appropriately scoped for MVP development.  [cite_start]The PM should systematically work through each item during the product definition process. 

## 1. PROBLEM DEFINITION & CONTEXT
- [ ] Clear articulation of the problem being solved
- [ ] Identification of who experiences the problem
- [ ] Explanation of why solving this problem matters
- [ ] [cite_start]User needs and pain points documented 

## 2. MVP SCOPE DEFINITION
- [ ] Essential features clearly distinguished from nice-to-haves
- [ ] Each Epic ties back to specific user needs
- [ ] [cite_start]Clear articulation of what is OUT of scope 

## 3. USER EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] Primary user flows documented
- [ ] [cite_start]Accessibility considerations documented 

## 4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] All required features for MVP documented
- [ ] Requirements are specific and unambiguous
- [ ] Stories follow consistent format
- [ ] [cite_start]Acceptance criteria are testable 

## 5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] Response time expectations defined
- [ ] Scalability needs documented
- [ ] Data protection requirements specified
- [ ] [cite_start]Platform/technology constraints documented 

## 6. EPIC & STORY STRUCTURE
- [ ] Epics represent cohesive units of functionality
- [ ] Epic sequence and dependencies identified
- [ ] [cite_start]First epic includes all necessary setup steps 

## 7. TECHNICAL GUIDANCE
- [ ] Initial architecture direction provided
- [ ] [cite_start]Known areas of high complexity or technical risk flagged for architectural deep-dive 

## 8. CROSS-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- [ ] Data storage requirements specified
- [ ] [cite_start]Integration requirements identified 

## 9. CLARITY & COMMUNICATION
- [ ] Documents use clear, consistent language
- [ ] [cite_start]Key stakeholders identified


# Product Owner (PO) Validation Checklist

[cite_start]This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate the complete MVP plan before development execution.  [cite_start]The PO should systematically work through each item, documenting compliance status and noting any deficiencies. 

## 1. PROJECT SETUP & INITIALIZATION
- [ ] Epic 1 includes explicit steps for project creation/initialization
- [ ] Local development environment setup is clearly defined
- [ ] [cite_start]All critical packages/libraries are installed early in the process 

## 2. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCING
- [ ] Database selection/setup occurs before any database operations
- [ ] Service architecture is established before implementing services
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline is established before any deployment actions
- [ ] [cite_start]Testing frameworks are installed before writing tests 

## 3. EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATIONS
- [ ] Steps for securely storing credentials are included
- [ ] [cite_start]Integration points with external APIs are clearly identified 

## 4. USER/AGENT RESPONSIBILITY DELINEATION
- [ ] User responsibilities are limited to only what requires human intervention
- [ ] [cite_start]All code-related tasks are assigned to developer agents 

## 5. FEATURE SEQUENCING & DEPENDENCIES
- [ ] Features that depend on other features are sequenced correctly
- [ ] [cite_start]Later epics build upon functionality from earlier epics 

## 6. MVP SCOPE ALIGNMENT
- [ ] All core goals defined in the PRD are addressed in epics/stories
- [ ] [cite_start]All technical constraints from the PRD are addressed 

## 7. RISK MANAGEMENT & PRACTICALITY
- [ ] Complex or unfamiliar technologies have appropriate learning/prototyping stories
- [ ] [cite_start]Risks with third-party services are acknowledged and mitigated 

## 8. DOCUMENTATION & HANDOFF
- [ ] Architecture decisions are documented
- [ ] [cite_start]User guides or help documentation is included if required 

## 9. POST-MVP CONSIDERATIONS
- [ ] Clear separation between MVP and future features
- [ ] [cite_start]Architecture supports planned future enhancements
